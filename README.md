# AppliCafé for Mobile Literacy in Senegal

# AppliCafé

An AppliCafé is a space inspired by cybercafés. Instead of focusing on fixed computers and software, it relies on a mobile structure, mobile devices, 
and mobile applications. People can interact with phones and tablets, and access the web by connecting to wifi provided at the structure. The main purpose 
of AppliCafé is to train users in mobile device literacy. 

This work was a collaboration between architects and computer scientists.

# Mobile App

The AppliCafé app is used as an accessible, educational tool. It features video tutorials, showcases curated local mobile apps that may interest users 
in Senegal, presents local developers, and provides engagement through Facebook. The app is available in French.

Videos included in the app are: “What is Android?”, “What is an app?”, “How to install an app”, and “What is Google Play?” etc. The videos are also accessible 
through our YouTube channel.
